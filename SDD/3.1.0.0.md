### 3.1.1 Calendar Manager

The Calendar Manager is a user who works with student tasks, events, assignments, reminders, etc.
There are several users who fall into the Calendar Manager category such as teachers, event coordinators, and students. Each user can perform similar
actions, but for different reasons. For example, a teacher may want to highlight a test deadline for
his or her students. A student may want to set reminders about a test or homework deadline throughout
the week.

### 3.1.2 Calendar Application

The Calendar Application represents the system and the actions it takes.

### 3.1.3 Administrative User
