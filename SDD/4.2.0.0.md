	determines which days of the week the event will occur on. This daily Occurence is passed in as a String array of days and is converted into an integer. This is called when the user selects the "Create Event" button. 
	A new event is created with the passed parameters, stored in the database, and is then returned to the U.I. Controller class to display to the user. See use case 3.4.1.2 for details.</td>
